# TrafficSignsDetection

This repository contains code and resources for detecting and recognizing traffic signs in images using computer vision techniques.

## Overview

Traffic sign detection plays a crucial role in enhancing road safety and autonomous driving systems. This project aims to provide a practical implementation of traffic sign detection using Python and popular computer vision libraries.

## Features

- Utilizes deep learning models for object detection and classification of traffic signs.
- Preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality and isolate signs.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for testing the model on custom images or video streams.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the pre-trained model weights (if applicable).
4. Run the detection script and test on images or videos.
